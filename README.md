# Project 2 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **18.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Filter page
   - [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
   - [x] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Loading HUD while results are fetched
- [x] Search results are numbered as in the actual Yelp app
- [x] Added transition between table view and map view like in the real app
- [x] Added in image fade in when downloaded from network
- [x] Switched to using v3 of Yelp's APIs, which allows us to get real price info, but we do lose the neighborhood info from the v2 search API
-


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. A table view could have so many different types of cells, I would like to see how they are implemented in industry and some best practices around how to represent the table structure and organize the code.
2. It would be fun to play around with the different map sdks.

## Video Walkthrough
